 <h1 class="page-heading">Beavers</h1>

 <p>Beaver Scouts are young people aged between six and eight years old. They belong to the first and youngest section in the Scouting family. Young people can join Beaver Scouts in the three months leading up to their sixth birthday. They can move up to the next section, Cub Scouts, around their eight birthday.</p>

 <p>Easily recognized by their distinctive turquoise sweatshirts, Beaver Scouts enjoy making friends, playing games, going on visits and helping others. They usually meet together once a week at the Scout Hut on either Tuesday (Bramble), Wednesday Bracken) or Thursday (Gorse).</p>

 <p>Beaver Scouts have lots of fun doing different activities which include making things, going on visits, making friends, doing badges and going away for a night on a sleepover. A Beaver Scout sleepover is often the first time a young person spends a night away from their family.</p>

 <p>Like all members of Scouting, Beaver Scouts make a promise when they join.</p>

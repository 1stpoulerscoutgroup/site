<p>Welcome to 1st Poulner Scout Group's Website. This site provides information about the group, useful information and details of up and coming events. We try hard to keep the site updated so please be patient if something is out of date.</p>

<h3>About The Group</h3>
<p>1st Poulner Scout Group is based in Poulner, Ringwood. The Group Scout Leader is Colin Andrews. The Scout Group tries to offer many varied events and activities to the young people from Climbing and Sailing, to annual summer camps, weekend camps and cycle expeditions, <a href="/events/ski-trip/">Skiing</a> in Switzerland, expeditions to <a href="/malawi">Malawi</a> and much much more...</p>

<p>The group is broken down into four different sections, <a href="/beavers">Beavers</a>, <a href="/cubs">Cubs</a>, <a href="/scouts">Scouts</a>, and <a href="/explorers">Explorers</a>.</p>

<p>All sections meet on weekday evenings.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Beavers meet on Tuesdays (Bramble), Wednesday (Bracken) and Thursday (Gorse)</li>
	<li>Cubs meet on Mondays (Saturn Pack), Tuesdays (Jupiter Pack) and Wednesday (Neptune Pack)</li>
	<li>Scouts meet on Wednesdays (Curlew Troop) and Fridays (Kingfisher Troop).</li>

</ul>

<h3>Booking the Hall</h3>
<p>Our Scout Hall at Poulner is used most weekday evenings. It is available for <a href="/booking">booking</a> on most weekends and/or school holidays.</p>
<p>We also run sections from our 'annexe' HQ at Strides Lane (off the Market Place) in Ringwood. This is the old 1st Ringwood Scout Group HQ, but sadly the group closed some years ago. This Hall is available for hire most weekends, and some weekday evenings.</p>

<h3>Multi Activity Centre (MAC) and Climbing Wall</h3>
<p>We are very proud to announce that after 5 years of fundraising the <a href="/mac">MAC</a> building has finally been finished and the Climbing Wall installed.  This term (Sep 14) will be the first chance that the Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers will get to climb on their own dedicated Wall.  There are many local groups who have also expressed an interest in making use of the fantastic new facilities.  We expect to be able to run sessions for other Scout and Guide groups in the new year.</p>

<p>Once the climbing wall has been in operation for a few months we are hoping to be able to offer sessions to the general public.  This is obviously dependent on a number of factors.  An essential one of these is finding people qualified with the correct Climbing Award Certification who would be willing to help out on a regular basis. Minimum level of qualification is CWLA or SPA. If you interested in running a 'club' then please contact Eddie Adams (Climbing Wall Operations Manger) at <a href="mailto:edwardadams@btinternet.com">edwardadams@btinternet.com</a></p>

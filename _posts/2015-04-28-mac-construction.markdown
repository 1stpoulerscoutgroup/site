We are very proud to announce that after 5 years of fundraising the MAC building has finally been finished and the Climbing Wall installed.  This term [Sep 14] will be the first chance that the Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers will get to climb on their own dedicated Wall.  There are many local groups who have also expressed an interest in making use of the fantastic new facilities.

We expect to be able to run sessions for other Scout and Guide groups in the new year.
Once the climbing wall has been in operation for a few months we are hoping to be able to offer sessions to the general public.  This is obviously dependent on a number of factors.  One essential one of these is finding people qualified with the correct Climbing Award Certification who would be willing to help out on a regular basis.  Minimum level of qualification would be CWA or SPA.  If you interested in running a 'club' then please contact Eddie Adams [Climbing Wall Operations Manger] at edwardadams@btinternet.com

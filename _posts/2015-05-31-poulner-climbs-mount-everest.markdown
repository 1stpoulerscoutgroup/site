<h4>Raising money for the Earthquake Appeal Fund</h4>

<p>On Sunday 31st May, Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorer Scouts set out to climb the height of Mount Everest in a sponsored climb to support the Earthquake Appeal for those poor Nepalese whose lives have been damaged through no fault of their own.  The West uses the Mountain as an adventurous pursuit, but the people who live there are incredibly poor and have very hard lives.  This they do not complain about and show great cheerfulness in adversity.</p>

<p>1st Poulner felt that the least they could do was use the new Climbing Centre (raised from donations from mainly the local community) to good effect.  So at 9 am on Sunday they set out to make 1445 climbs of the wall which would equal the 29,005 feet of Mount Everest.</p>

<p>Climbing went on all day, nonstop, with the young coming in shifts, donning their harnesses and helmets, and then getting on a part of the wall that was within their ability level.  Whether it was 6 year olds or 17 year olds, girls or boys, all of them scampered up the wall to touch the top and then down to ground again.  Most managed 10 climbs, many managed 20 climbs and just 1 or 2 managed 50 climbs.</p>

<p>At 5.02 pm the summit was reached and with the Union and 1st Poulner flags, the last ascent was made, with leader Mark Green and 2 young beaver scouts.   A total of over £1000 was raised and further monies are still coming in.  If you would like to make a donation to the Appeal then you could do that by going through Virginmoneygiving  on  <A href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/charity-web/charity/finalCharityHomepage.action?charityId=1004083">http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/charity-web/charity/finalCharityHomepage.action?charityId=1004083.</a></p>

<p>Group Scout Leader Colin Andrews said “This was a perfect project for the Group.  Helping other people.  Working as a team. Doing an adventurous activity.  Having fun.  The essence of Scouting”</p>

**Family Camp**

***Sat 18 - Sun 19 June 2016***

You will know that we have nearly completed all elements for our Outdoor Challenge Award (see attached), and we will sign you off the last element, when you attend the Family Camp!  Get a taste of wild camping with lots of activities, games in the Forest, and a wonderful camp fire to sit around (you can't get that on most campsites!)

If you do not know anything about this annual event which we have been running for about 15 years, then you are in for a wonderful treat!  Just talk to others who have attended in the past!  Apart from having amazing fun, we raise a significant amount for our Scout Group, which benefits all of your children. 

Please have a look and see how you can be involved in this fantastic event - and particularly, tell all your families, friends about it, and come along on the day 

Any queries, or offers of help, cakes, filled jam jars (or stuff to go in them), or anything else you can offer, please contact me on the above email address or 01425 652813 / 07731 872 564

 <h1 class="page-heading">Cubs</h1>

 <p>Cubs are young people aged between 8 and 10 1/2, who make up the second section of the Scouting family, between Beavers and Scouts.  Under some circumstances, Cubs can join the Pack as young as 7 1/2 if, for example, they have friends joining at the same time, or are mature enough to move on early from Beavers, (and there is space in the Pack). Such decisions are taken by Cub and Beaver leaders.</p>

<p>During their time in the Pack, Cubs will get a chance to try lots of different activities like swimming, hiking, exploring, fire lighting and collecting.  There are a range of badges available which Cubs can wear on their uniforms to show everyone how well they're doing.</p>

<p>Cubs also get to go on trips and days out, to places like the zoo, theme parks or a farm. Sometimes they will be able to go camping with the rest of the Pack and take part in all kinds of outdoor activities.  A Pack of Cubs is organised into Sixes, with each Six named after a colour, and a Sixer and a Seconder in charge.</p>

<p>The Cubs meet every week on either Monday (Saturn), Tuesday (Jupiter) or Wednesday (Neptune).</p>

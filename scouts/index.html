 <p>The Scout Section is for young people, usually aged between 10.5 and 14.5 years.  The Scout Troop is the third section in the Scout Group, above Beavers and Cubs.</p>

 <p>Scouts are encouraged to take part in a wide range of activities as part of their programme. Participation rather than meeting set standards is the key approach, and for the Scout who wants to be recognised for his or her achievements there are a number of Challenges awards and activity badges.</p>

 <p>Scouts take part in a Balanced Programme that helps them to find out about the world in which they live, encourages them to know their own abilities and the importance of keeping fit, and helps develop their creative talents. It also provides opportunities to explore their own values and personal attitudes.</p>

 <p>Being outdoors is important, and half the programme is given over to taking part in traditional Scouting skills, such as camping, survival and cooking, as well as a wider spectrum of adventurous activities, from abseiling and climbing, caving, canoeing and sailing to zorbing.</p>

 <p>A Scout Troop is divided into small groups called Patrols, each headed up by an older Scout called a Patrol Leader, and often with an Assistant Patrol Leader.  We currently have four patrols each with at least 6 people in it.</p>

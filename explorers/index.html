 <h1 class="page-heading">Explorers</h1>

 <p>Explorer Scouts are young people, usually aged between 14 and 18 years old. They make up the fourth section of the Scouting family after Beavers, Cubs and Scouts. They do a lot more adventurous stuff, ranging from weekend camps in Dartmoor to Urban challenges in Ringwood. As well as being great fun you learn a lot about the outdoors and many basic life skills.

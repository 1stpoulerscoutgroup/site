<h1 class="page-heading">Explorers</h1>

<p>Explorer Scouts are young people, usually aged between 14 and 18 years old. They make up the fourth section of the Scouting family after Beavers, Cubs and Scouts. They do a lot more adventurous stuff, ranging from weekend camps in Dartmoor to Urban challenges in Ringwood. As well as being great fun you learn a lot about the outdoors and many basic life skills. (Bring a torch)</p>

<p>Explorer scouting is very definitely about becoming an adult. The programme is balanced, but most of the activities will take place outside. There are normally only about 6 evenings held in the hall per year. The programme of activities are progressive and challenging.</p>

<p>Your son/daughter will have the opportunity to try new activities and to test themselves and their relationships with others. Teamwork and initiative training exercises linked to the activity programme are an important part of what the Explorer Scouts will do.

<p>Camping, hiking, bivouacs, wild woods camping and cooking, expeditions, and the opportunity to join Alpine weeks in the snow and every 2 years an expedition to Malawi in Southern Africa are all on offer.</p>

<p>'The Award' (formerly the Duke of Edinburgh's award scheme) is run at Bronze, Silver and Gold levels by a dedicated team of trainers at Strides Lane Hall.</p>
